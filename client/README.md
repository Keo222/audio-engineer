# Audio Engineer Website

This website is a templated version of a website that was created for an audio engineer to showcase their work.

It can be used to display a [bio](https://audio-engineer.herokuapp.com/about), show off [musical work](https://audio-engineer.herokuapp.com/listen) using Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music iframes that can be arranged and organized by both genre and type of work the audio engineer completed on each track, as well as multiple contact forms.

The website also uses a Node.js backend with a postgres database to allow the engineer to update track listings, available genres, and edit the text throughout the website. These [admin pages](https://audio-engineer.herokuapp.com/admin) are behind Auth0 authentication. For the purposes of this demo app, the admin pages can be accessed using this login information:

Username: testuser
Password: AudioPassword!100
